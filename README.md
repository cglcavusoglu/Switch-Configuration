# Switch-Configuration-via-Console-Port

This repository showcases a network simulation project utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on switch configuration through the console port. The console port serves as a serial connection point that allows direct access to the switch, enabling administrators to perform configuration tasks. By establishing a connection using a console cable, administrators can enter configuration commands through the console interface.
